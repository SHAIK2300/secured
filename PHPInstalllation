Installing PHP on Ubuntu is a relatively straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

First, update your package list by running the following command:
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Next, install the PHP package and any dependencies by running:
Copy code
sudo apt-get install php
This will install the latest version of PHP available in the default Ubuntu repositories.

Once the installation is complete, you can check which version of PHP is currently installed by running:
Copy code
php -v
In case if you want to use specific version of php. You need to use this command:
Copy code
sudo apt-get install -y php7.4
Finally, you'll also likely want to install some additional PHP modules.
Copy code
sudo apt-get install php-{module_name}
for example for mysql you can use

Copy code
sudo apt-get install php-mysql
For configuring the PHP for apache. you can use the following command:
Copy code
sudo a2enmod php7.4
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Once you've completed these steps, PHP should be fully installed and configured on your Ubuntu system.

Note: The commands above assume that you are using the Apache web server. If you are using a different web server, the process of configuring PHP may be slightly different.
